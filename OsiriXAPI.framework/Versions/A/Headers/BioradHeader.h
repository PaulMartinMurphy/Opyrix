  Bio-Rad(TM) .PIC Image File Information
  (taken from: "Introductory Edited Version 1.0", issue 1/12/93.)
  (Location of Image Calibration Parameters in Comos 6.03 and MPL .PIC files)

  The general structure of Bio-Rad .PIC files is as follows:

  HEADER (76 bytes)
  Image data (#1)
  .
  .
  Image data (#npic)
  NOTE (#1)
  .                       ; NOTES are optional.
  .
  NOTE (#notes)
  RGB LUT (color Look Up Table)


  Header Information:

  The header of Bio-Rad .PIC files is fixed in size, and is 76 bytes.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  'C' Definition              byte    size    Information
  (bytes)   
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int nx, ny;                 0       2*2     image width and height in pixels
  int npic;                   4       2       number of images in file
  int ramp1_min, ramp1_max;   6       2*2     LUT1 ramp min. and max.

  Bytes   Description     Details
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0-9     nx, ny, npic, ramp1_min, ramp1_max; (all are 2-byte integers)

  10-13   notes           NOTES are present in the file, otherwise there are
  none.  NOTES follow immediately after image data at
  the end of the file.  Each note os 96 bytes long.

  14-15   byte_format     Read as a 2 byte integer.  If this is set to 1, then
  each pixel is 8-bits; otherwise pixels are 16-bits.

  16-17   n               Only used in COMOS/SOM when the file is loaded into
  memory.

  18-49   name            The name of the file (without path); zero terminated.

  50-51   merged          see Note 1.

  52-53   colour1

  54-55   file_id         Read as a 2 byte integer.  Aways set to 12345.
  Just a check that the file is in Bio-Rad .PIC format.

  56-59   ramp2_min/max   Read as 2 byte integers.

  60-61   color2          Read as a 2 byte integer.

  62-63   edited          Not used in disk files.

  64-65   int_lens        Read as a 2 byte integer.
  Integer part of the objective lens used.

  66-69   mag_factor      Read as a 4-byte real.

  mag. factor=(float)(dispbox.dy*2)/(float)(512.0*scandata.ly)

  where:  dispbox.dy = the width of the image.
  scandata.ly = the width of the scan region.

  the pixel size in microns can be calculated as follows:

  pixel size = scale_factor/lens/mag_factor

  where:  lens = the objective lens used as a floating pt. number
  scale_factor = the scaling number setup for the system
  on which the image was collected.

  70-75   dummy[3]    Last 6 bytes not used in current version of disk file
  format. (older versions stored a 4 byte real lens mag
  here.)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Note 1 : Values stored in bytes 50-51 :

  0        : Merge off
  1        : 4-bit merge
  2        : Alternate 8-bit merge
  3        : Alternate columns merge
  4        : Alternate rows merge
  5        : Maximum pixel intensity merge
  6        : 256 colour optimised merge with RGB LUT saved at the end
  of each merge.
  7        : As 6 except that RGB LUT saved after all the notes.


  Information about NOTE structure and the RGB LUT are not included in this
  file.  Please see the Bio-Rad manual for more information.

  0-1     Display level of this note

  2-5     =0 if this is the last note, else there is another note (32 bit integer)

  10-11   Note type := 1 for live collection note,
  := 2 for note including file name,
  := 3 if note for multiplier file,
  := 4, 5, etc.,; additional descriptive notes

  16-95   Text of note (80 bytes)


  =============================================================================

  Info added by Geert Meesen from personal experiments.

  ------------------------------------------------------------

  - Until now I only have experience with 8-bit images from the MRC-1024 confocal microscope. 
  The newer microscopes (Radiance 2000, for example) are capable of generating 16 bit images, 
  I think. I have access to such a microscope and will try to find out later. For now it
  should be possible to look at the byte-word flag in the header.

  - I have experience with two types of images : 
  --- One slice in the Z-direction, 3 channels of recording. This type is stored as a three-slice image
  with the 3 channels in consecutive layers. (Single-Slice)
  --- Different Z slices with only one channel. (Z-stack)

  - The header should contain some info about the pixel-size, but until now I was not really
  able to interpret this info. It's easier to extract the info from the notes at the end.
  You can find 3 notes saying something like (from AUPCE.NOT, a Z-stack file)

  AXIS_2 001 0.000000e+00 2.999667e-01 microns                                    
  AXIS_3 001 0.000000e+00 2.999667e-01 microns                                    
  AXIS_4 001 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 microns                                    
  AXIS_9 011 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 RGB channel

  These lines give the pixelsize for the X (axis_2), Y (axis_3) and Z (axis_4) axis in the units mentioned. I don't
  know if this unit is always 'microns'.

  For a Single-Slice images you get ( from AB003A.NOT, a Single-Slice image) :

  AXIS_2 001 0.000000e+00 1.799800e+00 microns
  AXIS_3 001 0.000000e+00 1.799800e+00 microns
  AXIS_4 011 0.000000e+00 1.000000e+00 RGB channel

  It seems that AXIS_4 is used for indicating an RGB channel image.
